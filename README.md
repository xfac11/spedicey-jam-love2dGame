- The Store column indicates which store front the artifact is best suited for.
- The lua-https column indicates if supplemental HTTPS support is included with L√ñVE 11.5 builds
  - The `.love` file includes https native libraries for supported platforms, see [**USAGE.md**](USAGE.md) for more details.

## Quick Start

- **Don't fork this repository directly!**
- [**Create a new repository from this template**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for your game, then clone that repository.
- Open the `Workspace.code-workspace` file with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
  - You will be prompted that there are recommended extensions.
    - Click *'Install'*
- Remove our example *"game"* by:
  - Rename `game/main.template.lua` to `game/main.lua`.
  - Delete `game/eyes` directory.
- Configure [`game/product.env`](game/product.env) and [`game/conf.lua`](game/conf.lua) with the settings specific to your game.
  - Disable any platforms you do not want to target.
  - Full details on configuration can be found in the [**USAGE.md**](USAGE.md) file.
- Replace `resources/icon.png` with your game's high-resolution icon.
- If you are targeting Android, you need to create a keystore for signing your game; full details are in the [**USAGE.md**](USAGE.md) file.
- If you want to publish your game to [itch.io](https://itch.io/), you need to add [`BUTLER_API_KEY`](https://itch.io/user/settings/api-keys) to your GitHub repository; full details are in the [**USAGE.md**](USAGE.md) file.

### Running

- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> to **Run** the game.
- Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to **Debug** the game.
  - In debug mode you can use breakpoints and inspect variables.
  - This does have some performance impact though.
  - You can switch to *Release mode* in the `Run and Debug` tab (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>)

### Building

Builds a date stamped `.love` file and puts it in the `builds` folder.

- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> to **Build** the game.

### Performance Metrics

When the game is running you can access the performance metrics overlay by pressing <kbd>F3</kbd>.

#### Keyboard Controls

- <kbd>F3</kbd>: Toggle Overlay
- <kbd>F5</kbd>: Toggle VSync (only when benchmark is active)

#### Controller Controls

- Select + A: Toggle Overlay
- Select + B: Toggle VSync

#### Touch Controls

- Double Tap top right corner: Toggle Overlay
- Double Tap the overlay itself: Toggle VSync

### How to Register/Unregister Particle Systems for performance metrics

#### Basic Usage

```lua
-- When creating a particle system
local particleSystem = love.graphics.newParticleSystem(imageData)
overlayStats.registerParticleSystem(particleSystem)

-- Later, when you no longer need the particle system
overlayStats.unregisterParticleSystem(particleSystem)
```

#### Implementation Details

- **Where to register**: After creating any particle system you want tracked in your stats overlay
- **When to register**: Immediately after creating the particle system, typically in your load/initialization code
- **When to unregister**: When destroying the particle system or when it's no longer relevant to track
- **Implementation note**: Only active particle systems (`particleSystem:isActive()`) are counted
